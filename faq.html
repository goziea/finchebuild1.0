</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>After an offering closes on Finche, the investor capital goes to a newly-formed
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The SPV is a company created with the sole
purpose of keeping your investment secure, regardless of the originator. The
ownership of this vehicle is split among all investors in the deal or offering at a
basis corresponding to your contribution to the deal. Similarly, when the borrower
starts paying interest it is to the investors on a pro-rata basis on an agreed
payment frequency. For example, if the borrower is raising $500,000 and you
invest $5,000 in the offering, you will own 1% of the SPV and the underlying loan.
If the loan pays 10% interest per year, you will receive $500 in interest for each
year that the loan is outstanding.
